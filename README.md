Elm Workshop
===============================================================================

Let's do something with Elm!

A few "exercises" have been prepared where you are going to incrementally
tweak, fix and add features to a small app.

Before starting you need to have an editor and a few commands installed.

Install Elm using (see http://elm-lang.org/ for more info):

```
npm install -g elm
```

After this you will have a few useful commands available. Let's take a look at
step 1, start by running:

```
cd src
elm-reactor
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8000/Step1/Step1.elm.
This should show you the first stage of the app and some instructions on what
you need to do to it. The reactor can keep running the whole workshop there is
no need to restart it.
